Please create a splash logo image named 'splash_logo.png' in this directory.
The image should be at least 1152x1152 pixels and should be a PNG file with a transparent background.
Consider using your app icon or logo as the splash image.

After creating this image, run:
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create

For temporary testing, you can use a simple icon from your app (like the heart icon that's already used in the login screen) and create a PNG from it.
